## Security Features

This project implements several security measures:

### Authentication & Authorization
- JWT-based authentication
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Scope-based permissions
- Session management

### Data Protection
- PHI (Protected Health Information) redaction
- Sensitive data masking
- Input validation and sanitization
- SQL injection prevention

### API Security
- Rate limiting (100 requests per 15 minutes)
- CORS protection
- Security headers (Helmet.js)
- Request size limits

### Infrastructure Security
- HTTPS enforcement in production
- Environment variable protection
- Secure cookie settings
- Error handling without information leakage

### HIPAA Compliance
- Audit logging for all data access
- Data minimization practices
- Access controls and user authentication
- Secure data transmission

## Security Best Practices for Deployment

### Environment Security
- Use strong, unique JWT secrets (minimum 32 characters)
- Enable HTTPS in production
- Set secure environment variables
- Use a reverse proxy (nginx/Apache)
- Implement firewall rules

### Database Security
- Use connection pooling
- Implement database access controls
- Regular security patches
- Encrypted connections
- Backup encryption

### Monitoring & Alerting
- Monitor for unusual access patterns
- Set up security alerts
- Log security events
- Regular security audits

## Dependencies

We regularly update dependencies to address security vulnerabilities:
- Automated dependency scanning in CI/CD
- Regular security audits of third-party packages
- Prompt updates for critical security patches

## Security Audits

We recommend regular security audits including:
- Penetration testing
- Code security reviews
- Infrastructure assessments
- Compliance audits (HIPAA, SOC 2)

## Incident Response

In case of a security incident:
1. Immediate containment
2. Assessment of impact
3. Notification of affected parties
4. Remediation and recovery
5. Post-incident review
